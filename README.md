## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the application from the source code, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` and `venv`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/matbanik/Pomera-AI-Commander.git](https://github.com/matbanik/Pomera-AI-Commander.git)
    cd promera_ai
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```batch
        python -m venv venv
        .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` can be generated using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing via the build scripts.)*
    ```bash
    pip install reportlab python-docx requests Metaphone lemminflect pyaudio numpy anthropic openai cohere huggingface_hub groq
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python promera_ai.py
    ```

## üì¶ Building from Source

Build scripts are provided to create standalone executables for Windows and macOS.

### For Windows

Run the `build.bat` script. This will create a virtual environment, install dependencies using `pyinstaller`, and generate an executable in the `dist` folder.

```batch
.\\build.bat
```

### For macOS

Run the `build.sh` script. This uses `py2app` to create a `promera_ai.app` bundle in the `dist` folder, which you can then move to your Applications folder.

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1.  Launch the application.
2.  Select a tool from the "Text Processing Tool" dropdown menu.
3.  Enter your text into one of the "Text Input" tabs.
4.  Configure the tool-specific settings that appear next to the dropdown.
5.  For tools that require manual processing, click the "Process" button. Other tools will update the output in real-time as you type.
6.  The result will appear in the corresponding output tab.
7.  To use AI tools, enter your API key in the designated field.
